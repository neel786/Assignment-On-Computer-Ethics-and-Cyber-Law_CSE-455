CSE 455 Cyber Law Assignment

Overview

This repository contains my assignment for the Computer Ethics and Cyber Law course (CSE 455) at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University. Titled TechGuard’s Cyber Resilience Blueprint: Forging Bangladesh’s Digital Destiny, it proposes innovative cyber law reforms for Bangladesh, inspired by the 2024 student uprising that ousted Sheikh Hasina. The blueprint compares Bangladesh’s cyber laws with those of the US, UK, Germany, Japan, and Canada, and suggests youth-driven solutions to build a secure digital future.

I have provided the full assignment in the Pdf file that I have uploaded in this repository.
