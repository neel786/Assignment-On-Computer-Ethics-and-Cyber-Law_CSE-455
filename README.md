<h1>CSE 455 Cyber Law Assignment</h1>

**Overview**

This repository contains my assignment for the Computer Ethics and Cyber Law course (CSE 455) at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University. Titled Building a Resilient Digital Future : Proposing Legal Reforms for Cyber Law in Bangladesh Based on Leading Global Examples, it proposes innovative cyber law reforms for Bangladesh, inspired by the 2024 student uprising that ousted Sheikh Hasina. The blueprint compares Bangladeshâ€™s cyber laws with those of the US, UK, Germany, Japan, and Canada, and suggests youth-driven solutions to build a secure digital future.
